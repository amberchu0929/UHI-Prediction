# UHI-Prediction
This Jupyter Notebook explores the prediction of Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity through a data-driven approach. It walks through the full analytical process—from preprocessing and exploring satellite imagery data, to crafting meaningful features, and finally training a machine learning model. The goal is to estimate temperature variations linked to urbanization, providing insights that could support sustainable urban planning and climate adaptation strategies.
